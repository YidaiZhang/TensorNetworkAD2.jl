Today we have published our code in Github. We have made a lot of progress since the last report. We have implemented our understanding of TRG and recall the key points of this Algorithm, and explain our code line by line, to show a good solving for its partition function of a simple 2D ising model and plot our figures to reproduce the results of the aim paper. 

More details are included in our Github repo. You can find it from the link in Prof. Liu's github repo/issue.
